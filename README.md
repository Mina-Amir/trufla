This is a React project with some dummy data you can check the dummy data in <code>db.json</code>. The project is about companies that provide products, Some of the products have a discount code and some of them don't have discounts

## The steps to run the Project are

### `Download or clone the repo to your local machine`

<code> git clone git@github.com:Mina-Amir/trufla.git</code>

### `yarn run start-db`

This will start the dummy database at (http://localhost:3000)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. It will ask you to run the project on a different port like 3001 since the default port (3000) is already taken by the database.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional scripts

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
